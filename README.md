🔍 Linear and Binary Search Algorithms in C#
This repository contains simple and well-commented implementations of Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms using C#. These are classic search techniques used in computer science for finding elements in arrays or lists.

📘 Algorithms Explained
Linear Search: Iteratively checks each element until the target is found or the end of the array is reached.
Binary Search: Efficiently finds the target by repeatedly dividing the sorted array in half.
